# auto-track-sat

Project made using arduino, the main objective it's to track a satellite making use of a directional antenna that points to the specified selected satellite based on the geolocation of the tracker (device position), also taking into account the doppler effect and autoadjusting the frequency using an SDR (Software Defined Radio) for better comunication.

The First Iteration of the device using a 2dof arduino based PWM motors:
