# auto-track-sat

Project made using arduino, its objective it's to track a satellite making use of a directional antenna that points to the specified selected satellite based on the geolocation of the user, also taking into account the doppler effect and autoadjusting the frequency using an SDR (Software Defined Radio).

The First Iteration of the device using a 2dof arduino based PWM motors:
